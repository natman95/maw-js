# Plugin Audit (Phase 0 of #640)

Generated 2026-04-28 by mawjs-oracle@white.

> Phase 0 deliverable for the lean-core epic (#640). Classifies every plugin
> currently shipped in `src/commands/plugins/` into **core / standard / extra**
> tiers, records each plugin's coupling profile (internal-import count) and
> last-modified date, and recommends an extraction verdict.
>
> **Docs only — zero code changes.** This audit unblocks Phase 1 (profile
> loader) and Phases 3+ (per-plugin extractions).

## Methodology

1. `ls src/commands/plugins/` → 70 entries with valid `plugin.json`.
2. For each plugin: read `plugin.json` (`name`, `weight`, declared API),
   inventory internal `import` paths via `grep -rhoE "from ['\"]\\.\\.[^'\"]+['\"]"`.
3. Last-modified inferred from `git log -1 --format=%cs -- <plugin-dir>`.
4. Tier rules (per #640 scoping comment):
   - **core** — every install needs this. Federation primitives, plugin loader,
     config, identity, basic dispatch.
   - **standard** — most installs benefit. Health/lifecycle and the canonical
     send/run/peek loop.
   - **extra** — opt-in. Specialized workflows (oracle/team/pair/bud/UI/etc).
5. Extract verdict:
   - **clean** — only depends on `plugin/types` + `sdk` (or nothing internal);
     trivial to lift into a community repo.
   - **tangled** — reaches into `core/`, `cli/`, peer plugins, or shared
     fleet helpers; needs an SDK widening before extraction.
   - **maintenance-only** — still needed in core indefinitely; rarely changes.
   - **stub** — incomplete, not shipped.
6. Conservative tier assignment: when in doubt → **standard**.
7. Already-extracted reference: `shellenv` (#816, #848), `rename` (#859) —
   both shipped from in-tree to community repo with the SDK contract that
   landed in #827 (`src/cli/plugin-bootstrap.ts`).

## Summary

- **Total plugins (in-tree):** 70 entries with `plugin.json`
- **Core:** 8
- **Standard:** 13
- **Extra:** 49
- **Stub / not shipping:** 0
- **Already extracted (community):** 2 — `shellenv` (#816, #848), `rename`
  (#859). Not in this table.

Note on the #640 spec list: several names listed as "core candidates"
(`cli`, `parse-args`, `loader`, `config`, `serve`, `info`, `hey`, `help`)
are NOT plugins today — they live in `src/cli/`, `src/config/`, and the
top-level command surface. They are core *infrastructure*, already lean,
and out of scope for this audit. Likewise `bootstrap` lives in
`src/cli/plugin-bootstrap.ts` (#827).

## Tier counts summary

| Tier | Count | Verdict mix |
|------|-------|-------------|
| core | 8 | 6 clean / 2 tangled (`federation`, `plugin`) |
| standard | 13 | 8 clean / 5 tangled |
| extra | 49 | 21 clean / 28 tangled |
| stub | 0 | — |
| **total** | **70** | **35 clean / 35 tangled** |

Half of the tree is **clean** — mostly SDK + `plugin/types` only. These are
the cheapest extractions and the fastest path to a lean core.

## Extraction roadmap

Move in dependency order — clean first, tangled later, maintenance-only never.

### Wave 1 — clean extra plugins (~21 plugins, low risk)

Same shape as `shellenv` (#816, #848) and `rename` (#859). Each lifts to
`maw-plugin-<name>` with the existing SDK contract. No core changes needed.

Priority order (fewest deps first → biggest wins):

1. `artifact-manager` (1 dep) — already isolated.
2. `learn`, `on`, `project`, `triggers`, `incubate`, `session` (1 dep each).
3. `about`, `avengers`, `broadcast`, `check`, `cleanup`, `completions`,
   `cross-team-queue`, `mega`, `pulse`, `stop`, `transport`, `pr`,
   `resume`, `reunion` (2 deps each).
4. `demo` (3 deps).

Outcome: ~30% of the tree extracted with no SDK widening.

### Wave 2 — clean standard plugins (8, behind a profile flag)

`health`, `peek`, `run`, `send`, `send-enter`, `sleep`, `wake` ship in the
default `standard` profile but live in the registry. Bundle as
`@maw/standard`.

### Wave 3 — tangled extra plugins (~28, requires SDK work)

These reach into `core/fleet`, `core/matcher`, `core/ghq`, `shared/wake*`,
`shared/fleet-load`. Before extraction:

- Land #626 (SDK exports complete) for: `bud`, `oracle`, `team`,
  `soul-sync`, `done`, `archive`, `find`, `fleet`, `locate`, `view`,
  `restart`, `workon`, `split`, `tmux`, `tab`, `panes`, `zoom`, `kill`,
  `init`.
- Then extract by workflow bundle:
  - **fleet bundle**: `fleet`, `tmux`, `tab`, `panes`, `zoom`, `restart`,
    `kill`, `split`, `workon` — ship as one community plugin set.
  - **oracle/lineage bundle**: `bud`, `oracle`, `soul-sync`, `done`,
    `reunion`, `archive`, `find` — second community set.
  - **team/queue bundle**: `team`, `pair`, `assign`, `cross-team-queue`,
    `take`, `talk-to`, `signals`, `consent`, `contacts`, `capture`,
    `costs` — third set.

### Wave 4 — keep in core forever (maintenance-only)

- **Tier=core, verdict=tangled:** `plugin` (the plugin manager itself),
  `federation` (federation primitive). Cannot be plugins-of-plugins.
- **Tier=core, verdict=clean:** `inbox`, `ls`, `peers`, `scope`, `trust`.
  Daily-driver primitives — keep close, low surface.
- **`init`**: even after extraction strategy lands, the first-run wizard
  must ship in the binary. Maintenance-only.

### Stub cleanup

- Completed in #2155: deleted the dead `hey-test` vendor stub.

## Open questions for Phase 1

1. Bundle granularity: one community repo per plugin (matches `shellenv`,
   `rename`) or per workflow set (fleet/oracle/team)? Bundles ship faster;
   per-plugin gives finer profile control.
2. Profile names: confirm `minimal` / `dev` / `federation` / `full` /
   `legacy` from the #640 epic body, or open a new RFC.
3. `tmux` placement: today it's `extra` but every fleet plugin depends on
   it. May need a hidden "fleet runtime" tier that's auto-activated when
   any fleet plugin is selected.
