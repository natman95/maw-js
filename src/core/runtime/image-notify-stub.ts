/**
 * Image-attach wake-stub (#image-stall, 2026-06-07).
 *
 * When Boss attaches an image to an *idle* Oracle via the MAW dashboard, the
 * dashboard injects `[ภาพแนบ — โปรดดู: <path>]` straight into the pane via
 * send-keys (the `send` handler). An idle session has no active turn to fire,
 * and `oracle-inbox-sweep-all` — the cron that wakes offline sessions — only
 * watches top-level `ψ/inbox/*.md`, so it never sees the injected prompt. The
 * image then sits unanswered until Boss re-pings (observed 2026-06-06; worst for
 * Nari, who idles most).
 *
 * Fix: additionally drop a top-level inbox stub so the EXISTING sweep wakes the
 * session within ≤20 min. Additive only — does NOT touch the fire-turn path.
 * Fully fail-safe: every error is swallowed; image delivery must never be
 * blocked by stub bookkeeping.
 *
 * The inbox path is derived from the SAME fleet resolver `wake`/`restart` use
 * (`resolveTargetCwd`), so it stays correct for non-standard repos — notably
 * Nari, whose canonical inbox is `/root/projects/tconhr`, NOT `nari-oracle`
 * (fleet `05-nari.json` → `"repo": "tconhr"`). A naive `<oracle>-oracle` map
 * would silently drop into the dormant repo.
 *
 * Stub filename satisfies the sweep's find contract
 * (`oracle-inbox-sweep.sh`: top-level `*.md`, not `.*`, not `__CANARY-*`).
 *
 * @returns the written stub path, or null when skipped (no marker / unresolved
 *          non-fleet target / write failure).
