/**
 * doctor/cross-source-detect.ts — Sub-PR 2 of #841.
 *
 * Cross-source consistency analysis over `OracleManifest` (#838). Unlike
 * `peers/duplicate-detect.ts` (#810) which scans the peer cache for
 * `<oracle>:<node>` collisions, this layer asks a different question:
 *
 *   "For each oracle the manifest knows about, do the 5 registries AGREE
 *    enough that runtime paths (federation routing, awake state, fleet
 *    bring-up) will work?"
 *
 * Underlying fact: `loadConfig()` already auto-merges fleet windows into
 * `config.agents` at load time (src/config/fleet-merge.ts). So a fleet
 * window without an `agent` source label is rare on a healthy box — but
 * an `agent` entry without a backing fleet window IS common when
 * operators hand-edit `maw.config.json` ahead of registering the fleet,
 * or after deleting a fleet json without cleaning the agent map.
 *
 * Pure: takes a manifest snapshot, returns a list of warnings. No fs, no
 * network. The doctor surface adapts findings into the existing
 * `DoctorResult["checks"]` shape; tests can drive `findGaps()` directly.
 *
 * Severity philosophy
 * ───────────────────
 * Every gap is a WARNING, not a hard failure — operators legitimately keep
 * registries partly aligned during migrations (e.g. budding a new oracle
 * into `config.sessions` before its filesystem checkout exists). The
 * doctor entry returns `ok:true` in all cases; the message body counts
 * the gaps. Gating on `ok:false` here would force operators into
 * `--allow-drift` for normal mid-migration states, defeating the purpose.

/**
 * Walk the manifest and surface each gap pattern. Pure — feed it the
 * output of `loadManifestCached()` (or a hand-built fixture in tests).
 *
 * Patterns flagged:
 *
 *   1. agent-without-fleet
 *      `agent` source present, `fleet` absent, AND node === "local".
 *      An operator-added entry pointing to local with no fleet window
 *      backing it; `maw hey <name>` will think it's local but find no
 *      tmux session to wake.
 *
 *   2. session-without-fleet
 *      `session` source present, `fleet` absent, no `agent` either —
 *      a budded oracle whose Claude session UUID was recorded but no
 *      fleet window was ever registered. This is the "just-budded but
 *      not yet wired" state; usually transient but worth surfacing.
 *
 *   3. fleet-without-oracles-json
 *      `fleet` source present, `oracles-json` absent, AND no
 *      `localPath`. Indicates the registry cache (`oracles.json`) is
 *      stale relative to fleet; `maw oracle scan` will reconcile.
 *
 *   4. oracles-json-without-runtime
 *      Only `oracles-json` source. Filesystem-discovered oracle that
 *      no fleet/session/agent registry references. Either an orphan
 *      checkout (clone exists, never wired up) or a stale cache entry
 *      pointing at a deleted directory.
 *
 *   5. agent-mismatch-fleet-local
 *      `fleet` AND `agent` both present, but `agent` says a remote
 *      node while fleet implies "local". Federation routing will
 *      prefer the agent value (#736 precedence), so a `maw hey` will
 *      go remote even though there's a local fleet window — almost
 *      certainly a misconfigured agents map after a node migration.
