/**
 * scope-acl.ts — pure ACL evaluation for cross-oracle messages (#642 Phase 2 /
 * Sub-A of #842).
 *
 * Phase 1 (#829) shipped the scope primitive + `maw scope` CLI (list / create
 * / show / delete) writing per-scope JSON files at `<CONFIG_DIR>/scopes/<name>.json`.
 * Phase 2 introduces the routing decision: given a sender → target message
 * pair and the current scope set, should we deliver immediately or queue the
 * message for operator approval?
 *
 * This sub-PR (Sub-A of #842) ships JUST the pure decision function plus a
 * filesystem-aware loader (`loadAllScopes`). It does NOT wire into
 * `comm-send.ts` — caller integration lives in Sub-B/C so that this PR can
 * focus on the ACL semantics + tests without entangling the send hot path.
 *
 * Trust list: Sub-B introduced a `<STATE_DIR>/trust.json` (with legacy
 * config-path read fallback)
 * holding pairwise sender↔target whitelist entries that override scope
 * membership. The TrustList shape is declared here so the decision function
 * can already accept it; for Sub-A the caller passes `undefined` (or omits
 * the argument) and the helper treats trust as empty.
 *
 * Decision matrix:
 *
 *   sender == target                                  → "allow"  (self-msg)
 *   sender + target share at least one scope          → "allow"
 *   sender + target both listed in trust list         → "allow"
 *   otherwise                                         → "queue"  (default-deny
 *                                                                 cross)
 *
 * The function is intentionally pure — no I/O, no module dependencies on
 * file-system primitives. `loadAllScopes` is the dirty edge that mirrors
 * `cmdList()` in `src/commands/plugins/scope/impl.ts`. Mirrors the
 * pure-function pattern from `src/commands/shared/should-auto-wake.ts` (#837).
