# test/

800+ test files covering 89 vendor plugins, core transport, federation,
fleet management, and CLI commands.

## Canonical suite

Use `bun run test:all`. This is the ship gate — CI runs it on every PR
to `alpha` via 4-shard parallelism.

`test:all` runs four disjoint invocations so mocks don't cross-pollute:

1. `bun run test:default:safe`
2. `bun test test/isolated/`
3. `bun test test/zz-mock-transport-smoke.test.ts`
4. `bun test src/commands/plugins/`

`test:default:safe` keeps one shared Bun process for ordinary default-suite
files, then peels each default-suite `mock.module()` file into its own Bun
subprocess so cross-file retroactive mocks cannot leak into later tests.

`bun run test:coverage` mirrors those same four lanes for coverage collection:
default safe + isolated + mock smoke + plugin tests. It writes per-lane LCOV
parts under `coverage/`, merges them into `coverage/lcov.info`, then refreshes
`docs/testing/coverage-gap-analysis.md` and the public badge JSON.

## Why `bun test test/` (bare, no flags) is broken

Bun's `mock.module()` is **process-global and retroactive**. Two test files
that both mock the same path race inside one Bun process — one wins, the
other observes the wrong stub. Fix: run mutually-incompatible mockers in
separate invocations. Bare `bun test test/` puts them all in one process
and produces ~57 spurious failures; we accept that and ship via `test:all`.
See issue #387.

## Where `mock.module()` is allowed

- **`test/isolated/`** — invoked as its own `bun test` call by
  `test:isolated`. Each file may mock freely; pollution is contained.
- **`test/helpers/`** — shared mock definitions (imported, not executed).

New files outside those two directories **must not** call `mock.module()`.
`scripts/check-mock-boundary.sh` enforces this as a pre-tag gate. Options
when it trips:

- Move the test into `test/isolated/` (preferred).
- Add `// mock-boundary-ok: <reason>` on the offending line for a one-off
  justification (rare — `zz-mock-transport-smoke` is the canonical example).

`scripts/mock-boundary-allowlist.txt` grandfathers files that predate the
rule. That list is expected to shrink; adding new entries requires review.
